#. • t-latn-pre:  Prefix input method for

#. • t-latn-post: Postfix input method for

#. • t-rfc1345:   Generic input method using

#. • t-unicode:   For Unicode characters by typing
#. character code
#.
#. The translation does not need to have the same
#. number of words as the original English, any
#. number of words is fine. It doesn’t matter if the words
